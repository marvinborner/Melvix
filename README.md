## Disclaimer

This project is somewhat of a coding playground for me. It doesn't have any useful functionality (yet?). Be aware that the installation on real hardware is not recommended and may break your computer.

## Inactive

I've stopped developing Melvix because it wasn't interesting anymore. As I've rewritten Melvix many times, the following features may not all be available in the `dev` branch but scattered around all other branches and commits - sorry :P

## Features

-   From scratch (no POSIX/UNIX compatibility at all)
-   Multitasking
-   VFS with EXT2, DEVFS and PROCFS
-   Minimal GUI
-   Fast boot time (< 1s)
-   TCP/IP stack and rtl8139 driver
-   Small size (< 100KiB)
-   Sandboxed processes (paging, ring 3, SMAP/SMEP protections)
-   Full UBSan support
-   Compiles with `-Wall -Wextra -Werror -pedantic-errors -std=c99 -Ofast`

## Documentation

-   [Memory map](docs/MMAP.md)
-   [Bootloader overview](boot/README.md)
-   [Kernel overview](kernel/README.md)
-   [Userspace overview](apps/README.md)
-   [Library overview](libs/README.md)

## Contributions

If you decide to contribute to this project, these are some ideas that could get you started:

-   Fix some `TODO`s in the code. While these are often not very well described, most of them should be self-explanatory
-   Fix issues posted on GitHubs issues tab
-   Improve the size/speed of the system or the overall performance of libraries and functions
-   Find/fix security issues and potentially write an exploit
-   Add new features (whatever you like, really)
-   Huge parts of the code are kind of a mess to be honest. Feel free to make the code more beautiful :)
-   I'm not very good in design and frontend, so feel free to improve these kind of things too
-   Write more tests for the test suite (which is extremely incomplete at the moment)
-   Write/improve documentation - either in code or in the README, wiki or manuals.

Just remember to pass the test suite and follow the code formatting guidelines (`.clang-format`).
